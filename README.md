# System requirements
This package requires only a normal computer with standard RAM and CPU. For minimal performance, a computer with about 1 GB of RAM is recommended, but the follwoing standard is recommended:
RAM: 8+ GB
CPU: 2+ cores, 2.8+ GHz/core

For OS, any of the following can be used. 
Linux: Ubuntu:
Mac OSX:
Windows:

To run files Python3 and pylab must be installed in any of the above OS. The model is tested with Python 3.7.2.

# Installation guide

<b>Preparation:</b>

Download all the files and put them in the same folder and organise path.  
Instration can be done immediately, since it is simply based on copying files.  

# Demo (paper figures) instruction for use
